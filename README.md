# Pneumonia Detection from Chest X-Ray Images
Deep Learning Final Project â€” Bar-Ilan University, 2024  
**Authors:** Yuval Ronen & Mohammed Gara

---

## ðŸ©» Project Overview
This project focuses on classifying chest X-ray images into **NORMAL** and **PNEUMONIA** categories, and detecting pneumonia cases using **CNNs**, **transfer learning**, and **autoencoder-based anomaly detection**.

Our goal was to improve diagnostic support in medical imaging using deep learning techniques.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features
- **Transfer Learning:** EfficientNetB0 & ResNet152V2 fine-tuned for medical image classification
- **Autoencoder for Anomaly Detection:** Achieved **~90.5% success rate**
- **Explainability:** Heatmap-by-Occlusion visualization to show what the model focuses on
- **GPU Training:** Implemented and trained on Google Colab (Tesla T4)

## ðŸ§  Models Used
| Model | Purpose | Notes |
|------|---------|------|
| EfficientNetB0 | Transfer Learning Classifier | Best classification performance |
| ResNet152V2 | Transfer Learning Classifier | Fine-tuned last 35 layers |
| Autoencoder (CNN-based) | Anomaly Detection | ~90.5% detection accuracy |

## ðŸ”¥ Explainability (Heatmap by Occlusions)
To highlight which lung regions influence the model's decisions, we generate heatmaps by sliding blackout windows over the image.
